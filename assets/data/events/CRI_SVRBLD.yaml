# we'll format our research in YAML. it should be pretty easy to figure out the
# format, but generally a line starts w/ a key followed by a colon and a space,
# and then the value
#
# note that you should name your file CRI_<6 uppercase letters>.yaml in
# accordance with the ID format defined by the xml schema.
#
# if you want to check whether you've properly formatted it, you can run
# something like:
#
#   python -c "import yaml; print yaml.load(open('assets/data/crises/CRI_SVRBLD.yaml').read())"
#
# note that you need to format dates according to iso 8601, so if you have a
# date like "Apr 24, 2013, and you don't know how to format it, run this:
#
#   python -c "import yaml; print yaml.load(open('assets/data/crises/CRI_SVRBLD.yaml').read())"

# if you've got a really long line, you can make it multiline by putting a pipe
# character and then just indenting everything a couple spaces. if that doesn't
# make sense then just throw it all on one line.
