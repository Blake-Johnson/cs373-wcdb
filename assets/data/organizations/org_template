Create only one file per organization!
	i.e. only have one file called org_american_red_cross even though it has to do with Hurricane Sandy and Haiti
	Along those lines, be careful when merging!
File naming scheme is same as crisis.

For each organization, include at a minimum the following:
name: 
kind: 
location: 
history: 
contact_info: 
citations: 
external_links: 

images: 
videos: 
maps:
