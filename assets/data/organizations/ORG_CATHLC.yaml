history: |
  Catholic doctrine teaches that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus
  Christ. It interprets the Confession of Peter as acknowledging Christ's
  designation of Apostle Peter and his successors to be the temporal head of
  his Church. Thus, it asserts that the Bishop of Rome has the sole legitimate
  claim to Petrine authority and the primacy due to the Roman Pontiff.[1] The
  Catholic Church claims legitimacy for its bishops and priests via the
  doctrine of apostolic succession and authority of the Pope via the unbroken
  line of popes, claimed as successors to Simon Peter.[2][3][4][5] In 313, the
  struggles of the Early Church were lessened by the legalisation of
  Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380, under Emperor Theodosius
  I, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree
  of the Emperor, which would persist until the fall of the Western Empire, and
  later, with the Eastern Roman Empire, until the Fall of Constantinople.
  During this time (the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils) there were
  considered five primary sees according to Eusebius: Rome, Constantinople,
  Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria, known as the Pentarchy.  After the
  destruction of the western Roman Empire, the church in the West was a major
  factor in the preservation of classical civilization, establishing
  monasteries, and sending missionaries to convert the peoples of northern
  Europe, as far as Ireland in the north. In the East, the Byzantine Empire
  preserved Orthodoxy, well after the massive invasions of Islam in the mid-7th
  century. The invasions of Islam devastated three of the five Patriarchal
  sees, capturing Jerusalem first, then Alexandria, and then finally in the
  mid-8th century, Antioch.  The whole period of the next five centuries was
  dominated by the struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the
  Mediterranean Basin. The battles of Poitiers, and Toulouse preserved the
  Catholic west, even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850, and Constantinople
  besieged. In the 11th century, already strained relations between the
  primarily Greek church in the East, and the Latin church in the West,
  developed into the East-West Schism, partially due to conflicts over Papal
  Authority. The fourth crusade, and the sacking of Constantinople by
  renegade crusaders proved the final breach.  In the 16th century, in response
  to the Protestant Reformation, the Church engaged in a process of substantial
  reform and renewal known as the Counter-Reformation.[6] In subsequent
  centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a
  reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of
  Protestantism and also because of religious scepticism during and after the
  Enlightenment. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s introduced the most
  significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent three
  centuries before.
