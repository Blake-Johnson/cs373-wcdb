Create a new file per crisis so we don't accidentally override each other's work!
Name the file cri_*, replacing * with the crisis name with the following replacements:
	All letters are lowercase
	Any non-letter and non-digit value becomes an underscore
	e.g. HIV/AIDS becomes hiv_aids

For each crisis, include at a minimum the following:
name: 
kind: 
location: 
date_time: 
human_impact: 
economic_impact: 
resources_needed: 
ways_to_help: 
citations: 
external_links:
